            [ Verse 1 ]
            Good God have I been dreaming
            This paralyzing feeling?
            Was I left alone? Where have you gone?
            Were you somewhere else just sleeping?
        <br>
            [ Bridge 1 ]
            If I wait to wake you
            I'll never ask you
        <br>
            [ Chorus ]
            Would you take my hand?
            In the deepest end
            Would you stay and drown in me?
            Take my hand
            In the deepest end
            My open eyes see everything
        <br>
            [ Verse 2 ]
            But I'm passing all the days
            Through a window pane
            And as the scene would change
            I'd stay the same
            This paradise was nothing new
            But the paradise gets tired of you
        <br>
            [ Bridge 2 ]
            A single conversation
            Stole my attention
        <br>
            [ Chorus 2 ]
            Would you take my hand?
            In the deepest end
            Would you stay and drown in me?
            Take my hand
            In the deepest end
            Would you stay and drown in me?
        <br>
            [ Bridge 3 ]
            My open eyes see everything
            And you see nothing
            And don't forget it!
        <br>
            [ Chorus 3 ]
            Take my hand
            In the deepest end
            Would you stay and drown in me?
            Take my hand
            In the deepest end
            Would you stay and drown in me?
            Take my hand
            In the deepest end
            Would you stay and drown in me?
            You can stay and drown in me
            Would you stay and drown in me?
